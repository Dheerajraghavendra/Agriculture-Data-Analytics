weekly intervals. 
Poultry 
To minimize the summer effect, the following management practices need to be adopted 
- Arrange fans and foggers in sheds 
- Cover the sheds with paddy straw and arrange sprinklers 
- Feed poultry birds with wet mash to increase the feed intake 
- Provide cool water for drinking. 
Cattle and buffaloes 
• Prevailing weather conditions are congenial for the occurrence of 
− Foot and mouth disease in cattle,

− In Telangana region farmers can go for direct of seeding of rice under puddled 
conditions using drum seeder or broadcasting using sprouted seed of short 
duration varieties. 
− In remaining parts of the state, farmers can go for direct of seeding of rice under 
puddled conditions using drum seeder or broadcasting using sprouted seed of

Management practices for areas affected by excess rains and floods

Rice
   • If lodging occured at milky stage, drain out the water and lift the lodged plants and
      spray Validamycin @ 2 ml or Hexaconazole @ 2 ml or Propiconazole @ 1 ml per litre
      of water to control sheath blight.
   • If lodging occured at maturity stage, drain out the water and spray 5% sodium salt (50g
      per litre of water) on lodged plants to avoid germination.
   • If inundation occured after harvesting of the crop spray 5% sodium salt (50g per litre
      of water) on paddy sheaves.
   • Prevailing weather conditions are congenial for incidence of panicle mite and blast. To
      control,
      Panicle mite
      − Spray Profenophos @ 2 ml per litre of water before flowering.
      Blast
      − Spray Tricyclazole @ 0.6 g or Isoprothiolone @ 1.5 ml per litre of water.
   • To control the rodent damage in flood affected rice areas.
      − Fumigate with Aluminium phosphide tablets @ 1.2 g per burrow, or use burrow
         fumigator.
      − Poison bait with Bromadiolone @ 10 to 15 g per burrow by mixing 96 parts of
         broken rice: 2 parts oil: 2 parts Bromadiolone in live burrows and in the field.
      − Use rat traps.
     Note: The rodent management has to be taken up on community basis for effective
     control.

Rice
    • Prevailing weather conditions are congenial for incidence of panicle mite and blast. To
      control,
      Panicle mite

      − Fumigate with Aluminium phosphide tablets @ 1.2 g per burrow, or use burrow
         fumigator.
      − Poison bait with Bromadiolone @ 10 to 15 g per burrow by mixing 96 parts of
         broken rice: 2 parts oil: 2 parts Bromadiolone in live burrows and in the field.

Irrigated Dry crops
   • Due to insufficient recharge of ground water, farmers are advised to go for irrigated
       dry crops like maize, groundnut, sunflower etc. wherever feasible instead of rice
       cultivation even under wells and bore wells.
   • Raise irrigated dry crops like maize and sunflower as an alternative to irrigated rice
       under wells as the ground water is going to be scarce due to drought. Under
       inevitable situations, prefer short duration rice varieties.
